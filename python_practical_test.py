# Python Practical Test

# Instructions:
# 1. Read each question carefully.
# 2. Write your Python code to solve each problem.
# 3. Feel free to use external resources (documentation, Google) as you normally would when programming.
# 4. For each question, provide a comment with your explanation or thought process.
# 5. Remember to use meaningful variable names and follow clean code principles.
# 6. If you encounter any issues or uncertainties, you can indicate that in a comment.


# Question 1:
# Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.



# Question 2:
# Create a class called "Person" with attributes for name, age, and city. Implement a method within the class that returns a string representation of the person's information.



# Question 3:
# Given a string, write a Python function that checks if it's a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). The function should return True if it's a palindrome, False otherwise.



# Question 4:
# Write a Python program that reads a CSV file named "data.csv" (you can create a sample CSV file) and prints the contents to the console.



# Question 5:
# Implement a Python function that takes a list of words as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the words, and the values are the lengths of the words.



# Question 6:
# Create a Python class called "Rectangle" with attributes for length and width. Implement methods within the class to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.



# Question 7:
# Write a Python program that uses a while loop to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer. The user should input the integer.



# Question 8:
# Given a list of numbers, write a Python function that returns a new list containing only the numbers that are divisible by 5.



# Question 9:
# Write a Python function that reads a text file named "sample.txt" (you can create a sample text file) and counts the number of words in the file.



# Question 10:
# Create a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The user should input the number of terms.
